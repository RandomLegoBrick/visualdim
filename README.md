# Work in progress

Hopefully a slightly smart application to take rough measurements with a microscope

Rough pipeline:

Image from microscope -> scale calibration using some sort of printed pattern -> compensation for distortion -> canny edge detection -> vertex data -> regression for primative shapes -> dimensional data
