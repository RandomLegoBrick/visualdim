Work in progress

Hopefully a slightly smart application to take rough measurements with a microscope

Rough pipeline

Image from microscope -> scale calibration with some sort of image pattern -> compensation for distortion -> canny edge detection -> vertex data -> regression from primative shapes -> dimensional data

This is just a vibe coded test, never actually used ai to program things so this is new lol
